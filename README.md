#Managing Inventory Costs with Varying Order Quantities
A retail store wants to optimize its inventory costs by adjusting order quantities and negotiating unit prices with suppliers. The store needs to understand how changes in order quantity and unit cost affect the total inventory cost.
Objective: Create a data table to model inventory costs by multiplying order quantities with unit costs, then vary both inputs to analyze the impact on total cost.
